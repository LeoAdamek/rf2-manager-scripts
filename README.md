# rFactor2 Manager Scripts

Powershell cmdlets and scripts for managing rFactor 2 servers.


# Usage

## Setup

Add the cmdlets to your powershell modules:

````
  Import-Module -Path $pathToRf2Manager.ps1
````

## Install content from Steam Workshop

Use the `Install-Rf2-Mod` cmdlet to install a mod:

````
Install-Rf2-Mod <WORKSHOP_ID> -Path <RF2_INSTALL_PATH>
````

The script will download the mod content automatically from the workshop and add an extry to its internal DB. It will get the mod name from the Workshop page.
It deletes the workshop download directory to save space -- Otherwise servers require 3 copies of every mod which is very waseful of space.

### Note on DLC

You must use the `-Dlc` flag when installing DLC content, you must also provide a `-Name` as the script is unable to get mod names for DLC items as they don't
have public workshop pages to scrape.

## Update Mods

````
Update-Rf2-Mods -Path <RF2_INSTALL_PATH>
````

This will use the mod DB generated by `Install-Rf2-Mod` to download all mods. Because the workshop download directory is automatically cleaned up, the tool must fully re-download all mods.
